-# 🎆 New Year’s Eve — Goodbye 2025

Today is New Year’s Eve, the final day of 2025.

As this year comes to an end, it feels like the right moment to pause and look back. 2025 was a year of learning, experimenting, and slowly understanding how things really work. Some ideas worked, some didn’t — but every attempt taught me something valuable.

This year reminded me that progress isn’t about speed, it’s about consistency. Small steps, repeated often, actually lead somewhere.

✨ Looking Back at 2025

This year was about:

Learning through trial and error

Building things instead of just thinking about them

Getting more comfortable with technology and coding

Accepting mistakes and improving from them

🚀 Looking Ahead

As a new year begins, I want to:

Keep learning and building

Improve my skills step by step

Make this website better over time

Stay curious and motivated

Thank you, 2025, for the lessons.
Onward to the next chapter 🌟

Happy New Year!
